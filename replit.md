# User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Header layout: Text and titles positioned on the right side, theme controls (color selector and day/night toggle) positioned on the left side (Arabic RTL layout).
Sidebar toggle button: User prefers toggle button positioned on the left side of the sidebar.
Design preference: Complete elimination of all hardcoded purple and blue colors. All UI elements must use dynamic theme colors instead of fixed purple/blue colors. All gradients, buttons, borders, and components must follow the selected color theme dynamically.
Theme controls: User prefers theme selector and day/night toggle buttons in page header left side, with page title text on the right side (Arabic RTL layout). Theme control buttons should be positioned close together with minimal spacing (gap-2) for consistent appearance across platform pages.
Color system: Dynamic theme system with complete removal of hardcoded colors. All components use CSS variables for theme colors (--theme-gradient, --theme-primary, --theme-primary-light, --theme-primary-lighter). No fixed purple (#a855f7) or blue (#3b82f6) colors anywhere in the system.
Platform pages layout: All platform pages (platform-dashboard.tsx, products.tsx) use unified PlatformSidebar layout with consistent theme control positioning and spacing. Main dashboard pages maintain their original layout structure.
Image hover preferences: User prefers smaller hover image sizes for clear viewing with dark background overlay. Documents scale 1.4x and profile images scale 1.3x on hover, with dark non-transp background (85% opacity) for better focus and visibility.
Modal design preferences: User prefers complete non-transparency (100% opacity) for modal backgrounds using bg-black. All form elements (input, textarea, select dropdowns, checkbox, switch) use consistent theme colors instead of system purple/blue colors. Dropdown menus have dark backgrounds with theme-colored borders and hover effects.
Employee card layout: User prefers employee profile image and name positioned on the right side of the card, with action buttons (delete and settings) positioned on the left side, following Arabic RTL design principles.
Checkbox spacing: User requires proper spacing between checkboxes and text labels in permission dialogs. Implemented gap-4 (16px) spacing in employee permission modals for better readability and user experience.
Sidebar navigation preferences: User prefers "ÿ≠ÿ≥ÿßÿ®ÿßÿ™Ÿä" (My Accounts) positioned between Ads section and Accounting system in sidebar navigation for optimal access flow.
UI Layout preferences: User prefers compact and organized page layouts with smaller cards, reduced text sizes, minimal spacing between elements, and efficient use of screen space. All statistical cards and content sections should use reduced padding (p-2 to p-3), smaller text (text-sm to text-base), and tighter gaps (gap-2 to gap-3) for better visual organization.
Circular badge design: User prefers colored circular badges for displaying numbers in both toolbar buttons and statistics cards. The circular badges should use dark versions of the background color (e.g., bg-yellow-800 for yellow backgrounds, bg-purple-800 for purple backgrounds) with white text for optimal contrast and readability. This creates a cohesive visual system where badges complement their parent container colors.
Employee management page layout: User prefers clean layout without redundant titles and counters. Action buttons (add employee, employee login) positioned on the right side, filter controls with labels positioned on the left side. Filter label text positioned directly next to dropdown menu rather than separately. Employee count badge displayed alongside filter controls.
